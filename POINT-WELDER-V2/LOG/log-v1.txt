Tested the circuit (V1) for the first time. I have been too afraid to "play" with batteries, but today I tested it, and it works. There are some improvements that can be made, for sure, but the circuit did not blow up, nor did the battery - I call that a win. 
The weld between two thin plates was very strong.
I wish to develop a version 2 (V2) of the circuit to improve certain aspects of it, and then test it thuroughly.
