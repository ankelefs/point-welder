### 08.12.22
Tested the circuit (V1) for the first time. 
I have been too afraid to "play" with batteries, but today I tested it, and it works. 
There are some improvements that can be made, for sure, but the circuit did not blow up, nor did the battery - I call that a win. 
The weld between two thin plates was very strong.
I wish to develop a version 2 (V2) of the circuit to improve certain aspects of it, and then test it thuroughly.

------------
### 18.12.22
Worked on schematics and PCB.

Needs to be done:
* ✅ Make sure all dimensions are correct (headers, OLED-screen).
* ✅ Make sure the schematic is "usable".
* ✅ Export PCB to Fusion 360 to start 3D-modelling.
* ✅ Import all relevant documents to GitHub-folder (datasheets, circuit-schematics/-figures ++).

------------
### 20.12.22
Worked on schematics:
* Changed DRIVER-MOSFET to be low-side-implemented (for switching).
* Changed POWER-MOSFET to be high-side-implemented (for giving power). ❗️ Need to double check - it may have to be low-side-implemented if weld-resistance is higher than Rds of MOSFET (Thanks for feedback, Sindre).

Worked on board layout (PCB):
* Added holes for mounting.
* Finalized trace widths and the general layout.

Worked on 3D housing-model:
* A rough skecth is now complete.

Needs to be done:
* ❌ Implement Miro with GitHub
* ✅ Check schematics and maybe change POWER-MOSFET to be low-side-implemented.
* ❌ 3D: Add screw holes at the top of the pillars (topside) for mounting components together.
* ❌ 3D: Add bracket for mounting OLED-display (nicely).
* ⚠️ 3D: Add spacers for PCB to rest upon and be fastened to with screws.

------------
### 27.12.22
Schematics:
* Removed capacitor before buck converter. Reason: BAT+ signal need good clearing - caused problems and not much needed.
* Changed to low-side configuration for power-MOSFET.
* Completed.

PCB:
* Almost completed.

To do:
* ⚠ A new 3D-model that encapsulates it more and is more aesthetic.
* ⚠️ 3D-model needs implemented fastener for cables and OLED-display.
* ✅ Edit README-files.
  
------------
### 30.12.22
Schematics: 
* Renumbered items.
 
PCB:
* Finishing touches. 
* Ordered lacking components: IRLB3034 (Digi-Key) and 10k potmeter (Digi-Key). Total order sum: 568,20 kr (IRLB3034: 7 pcs, potmeter: 2 pcs). 🥳

To do:
* ✅ Look at potmeter datasheet and change pin location so that the rotary dial sticks out "perfectly" from the enclosure.
* ✅ Order PCBs. --> Finish 3D-model.

------------
### 31.12.22
PCB:
* Changed position of potentiometer.
* Changed position and dimension (3 mm) of holes for fastening to a base (enclosure).
* Ordered! 🥳

I see from the picture that the names/values of the resistors are not in it. They should be moved to either the tValue or tName layer to be printed on the silkscreen. But this is not a big concern since it is a fairly easy electronic schematic/design.

Only need to design the enclosure (prefarably before the PCBs arrive) and make/assemble it. Need to figure out if it should be made with fully 3D-printed parts or if the design is nicer if it's made with acrylic glass. 

------------
### 01.01.23
Finished the 3D-model design. It only needs a few minor adjustments with regards to the cable dimensions (need to make sure the holes are big enough).

* ⚠️ Need to find which cables to buy and double check dimensions in 3D-model.
* ⚠️ Need to then make an ergonomic holder for the weld tips.
* ⚠️ Need to find properly sized crocodile clamps for the cable ends that go to the battery.
