## 08.12.22
Tested the circuit (V1) for the first time. 
I have been too afraid to "play" with batteries, but today I tested it, and it works. 
There are some improvements that can be made, for sure, but the circuit did not blow up, nor did the battery - I call that a win. 
The weld between two thin plates was very strong.
I wish to develop a version 2 (V2) of the circuit to improve certain aspects of it, and then test it thuroughly.

## 18.12.22
Worked on schematics and PCB.
Needs to be done:
[x] Make sure all dimensions are correct (headers, OLED-screen).
[x] Make sure the schematic is "usable".
[x] Export PCB to Fusion 360 to start 3D-modelling.
[x] Import all relevant documents to GitHub-folder (datasheets, circuit-schematics/-figures ++).

## 20.12.22
Worked on schematics:
  * Changed DRIVER-MOSFET to be low-side-implemented (for switching).
  * Changed POWER-MOSFET to be high-side-implemented (for giving power).
  (!) Need to double check - it may have to be low-side-implemented if weld-resistance is higher than Rds of MOSFET (Thanks for feedback, Sindre).
Worked on board layout (PCB):
  * Added holes for mounting.
  * Finalized trace widths and the general layout.
Worked on 3D housing-model:
  * A rough skecth is now complete.
Needs to be done:
[] Implement Miro with GitHub
[] Check schematics and maybe change POWER-MOSFET to be low-side-implemented.
