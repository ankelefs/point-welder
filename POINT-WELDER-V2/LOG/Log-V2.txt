Tested the circuit (V1) for the first time. 
I have been too afraid to "play" with batteries, but today I tested it, and it works. 
There are some improvements that can be made, for sure, but the circuit did not blow up, nor did the battery - I call that a win. 
The weld between two thin plates was very strong.
I wish to develop a version 2 (V2) of the circuit to improve certain aspects of it, and then test it thuroughly.

Worked on schematics and PCB.
Things to do:
[] Make sure all dimensions are correct (headers, OLED-screen).
[] Make sure the schematic is "usable".
[] Export PCB to Fusion 360 to start 3D-modelling.
[] Import all relevant documents to GitHub-folder (datasheets, circuit-schematics/-figures ++).
